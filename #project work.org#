** What is IR Drop?

The potential difference,or voltage drop, between two ends of a conducting
wire during current flow is called IR drop (from Ohm’s law: V=IR).
In chips, power and ground are distributed through metal networks
constituting the power delivery networks (PDNs). When current flows
through the PDN, part of the voltage is dropped across the network,
as per Ohm’s law. This phenomenon is called IR drop.

This voltage drop in the power delivery network before
the voltage reaches standard cell
power pins significantly affects the chip's switching speed and performance.
The same effect on the ground net leads to ground bounce, in which
the nominally zero voltage rises above zero.


** Why IR drop analysis is important?
+ Excessive IR drops degrades the circuit performence.
+ Leads to functional failure
+ Some ATPG test vectors causes excessive IR drop that results yield loss.


** Types of IR drop analysis
+ Static IR drop
  + Based on leackage power of transistor or standard cell.
+ dynamic IR drop
  + vectorless
  + vectorbased







+ What is follow pin in VLSI physical design?
 In VLSI physical design, a follow pin is a special type of pin used to
 specify the routing direction of a net or signal. The follow pin is used
 to guide the routing of a net, making sure that it follows a specific
 direction or path.


Follow pins are often used in high-speed digital circuits, where the routing
of signals can significantly affect the performance of the circuit.
Designers may ensure that the signal takes the best path by setting
the routing direction of a net using a follow pin, lowering the chance of
crosstalk and other problems.

• innovus.cmd – Contains list of commands executed during the session. This file
can be used to create scripts to automate the execution of the commands and learn
what text commands correspond to commands executed through the GUI.
• innovus.log – Contains basic information output from the executed commands. The
commands in the file are preceded with in the file.
• innovus.logv – Similar to innovus.log but contains a more verbose amount of output. Useful for debugging

** .lib file structure

The timing library (.lib) is an ASCII representation of the Timing, Power and Area associated with the
standard cells.
Characterization of cells under different PVT conditions results in the timing library (.lib).
The delay calculation happens based on input transition (Slew) and the output capacitance (Load).
Nowadays, CCS and ECSM models are used to characterize the library, where the calculations are based
on current models which is more accurate. (In earlier days, it was NLDM model which was based on voltage
calculation.)
There are basically three major parts in the .lib file:
Global definition
Cell definition
Pin definition
